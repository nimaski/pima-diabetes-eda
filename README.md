# 🧬 Diabetes Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which includes diagnostic information for predicting the onset of diabetes in women of Pima Indian heritage.

> The analysis aims to explore the structure, clean the dataset, and prepare it for future machine learning modeling.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Pima Indians Diabetes dataset
- **Samples**: 768 female patients
- **Features**: 8 health metrics (Glucose, BMI, Age, etc.)
- **Target**: 0 (No Diabetes), 1 (Diabetes)
